### 2. ESG – Verified, Automated, and Trustworthy

LeXurey is developing **zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)** based tools that automatically verify ESG compliance—without revealing sensitive internal data.

Current ESG solutions vary greatly across institutions, leading to fragmented standards and unverifiable impact claims. Fraud and misreporting remain persistent risks.

Our solution combines **Web3 transparency with ZKP security**, enabling:
- Universal APIs to upload and cryptographically verify ESG data
- Instant proof validation — where **everyone becomes the auditor**
- Easy integration without the need for expensive system overhauls

We empower businesses to gain regulatory trust and sustainability benefits through **tamper-proof ESG reporting**.
