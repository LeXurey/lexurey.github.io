## 🔭 Our Vision

At LeXurey, we are building a future where **enterprise trust, environmental accountability, and operational transparency** converge through blockchain-integrated ERP systems.

We are committed to pioneering solutions that:
- Automate ESG compliance
- Ensure verifiable carbon credit integrity
- Embed zero-knowledge privacy into real-world business workflows

---

## 🧩 What We Do

- **ERP Implementation & Blockchain Integration**
- **ZKP-based Carbon Credit Lifecycle Tools**
- **ESG & Sustainability Reporting Automation**
- **Smart Contract Security and Source Mapping**
- **Compliance Toolkits & Open-Source Libraries**

---

## 🚀 What Makes LeXurey Capable

- **Technical Depth**: Advanced research and development in zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) smart contracts, static analysis, and ERP interoperability.
- **Enterprise Experience**: Hands-on delivery of middleware and system integration for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central and NetSuite.
- **Security-first Design**: Custom profit-centric fuzzing pipelines that detect logic vulnerabilities before deployment.

---

## 🎯 Research Questions Driving Our Innovation

1. How can ZKPs be integrated into ERP workflows for cost-efficient, scalable carbon-credit issuance?
2. What architectural designs ensure secure, real-time blockchain↔ERP data exchange?
3. Which ZKP schemes and optimizations offer high-throughput, privacy-preserving proofs?
4. How can adversarial testing expose hidden vulnerabilities in smart contracts?
5. How can evolving ESG standards be enforced through privacy-preserving verification?

---

## 🛠️ Our Solution

We are developing a **Blockchain-Integrated ERP Extension** that:
- Automatically generates verifiable ZKP-based carbon credit records
- Publishes proofs to blockchain without exposing sensitive enterprise data
- Aligns with major ESG frameworks and privacy regulations (VCS, GDPR, etc.)
- Offers plug-and-play integration with Business Central and NetSuite

---

## 🔄 Action in Progress

- Building smart contracts with zkSolc and Circom
- Designing source-mapped tooling for smart contract analysis
- Developing middleware to connect ERP data with blockchain ZKP layers
- Running pilot tests with enterprise clients
- Preparing an open-source ESG Compliance Toolkit

---

## 🤝 Partnerships

- **UNSW Sydney** – Academic co-lead (Prof. Yuekang Li), formal methods & fuzz testing
- **DFCRC** – Doctoral collaboration & applied research platform
- **Clients** – Small and medium enterprises with carbon credit issuance needs

---

## ⚠️ Limitations We’re Tackling

- Complexity of integrating zero-knowledge proofs into legacy ERP systems
- Performance trade-offs in large-scale carbon-credit verification
- Ensuring compliance without compromising data privacy
- Building trust in emerging ESG technology ecosystems
